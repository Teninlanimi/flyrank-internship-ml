# Machine Learning for Content Refresh Prioritization

**Which pages should an SEO team review first for a refresh?** During my Machine Learning Engineer internship at FlyRank AI (June–October 2026), I built a model that ranks existing pages by how likely they are to be in decline, so content teams can spend limited review time on the right pages first.

**[Read the research paper](https://teninlanimi.github.io/flyrank-internship-ml/)** · Python · scikit-learn · Quarto

## Results

Each model was evaluated with **five-fold client-grouped cross-validation**: every fold tests on clients the model never saw in training, so the scores reflect performance on new websites. Ranking quality is measured with **Precision@K**, the share of the top K flagged pages that were actually declining. That matches how the output is used, since a team only works through the top of the queue.

Mean Precision@K across the five held-out client groups (± standard deviation):

| Model | Precision@20 | Precision@50 | Precision@100 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Logistic Regression** | **0.83 ± 0.05** | **0.76 ± 0.09** | **0.74 ± 0.12** |
| Random Forest | 0.76 ± 0.17 | 0.71 ± 0.16 | 0.71 ± 0.15 |
| Decision Tree | 0.47 ± 0.35 | 0.51 ± 0.35 | 0.51 ± 0.33 |
| Rule-based baseline | 0.43 ± 0.18 | 0.47 ± 0.17 | 0.47 ± 0.14 |

The dataset has 30,000 pages, and 54.2% are declining, so a random queue would score about 0.54.

### What the results show

- **Logistic Regression is the recommended model.** It nearly doubles the baseline's Precision@20 (0.83 vs 0.43) and stays strongest at every queue size.
- **It is also the most consistent.** Its Precision@20 varies by only ±0.05 across client groups, against ±0.17 for Random Forest and ±0.35 for the Decision Tree. That matters because a model that works well for some clients and poorly for others gives unreliable queues.
- **The rule-based baseline performs below the 54% base rate,** which shows the hand-weighted heuristics were not capturing what actually signals decline.

## Making the Evaluation Trustworthy

- **Client-grouped validation over row-level validation.** An earlier row-level split gave Logistic Regression a Precision@20 of 0.90. I treated that as optimistic, because rows from the same client can appear in both training and test data, and based the final results on client-grouped folds instead.
- **Leakage audit.** `trend_direction` and `trend_pct` describe the outcome directly, so they were excluded from the features. Client and content IDs were excluded too, and `client_id` was used only to build the validation folds.
- **Baseline comparison.** Every model is judged against the repository's transparent rule-based score.

## Intended Use

The model is a **decision-support tool, not an automatic refresh system.** It produces a ranked queue, and an editor reviews each page's signals before deciding whether to refresh it, monitor it or leave it alone. The target is an observed declining trend, so a high score does not prove that refreshing the page will improve its performance.

# FlyRank ML Internship — Starter Repo

**Applied Search Intelligence: Google Search Ranking & Discoverability**

This is the starting point for the FlyRank ML Internship. You **clone it into your own public
repo** (one click — *Use this template*), build everything there, and submit that repo URL on
each assignment in your portal — it's your workspace, your submission, and your portfolio all
at once. The rhythm is simple: do the work, commit it, submit on the card. Done.

Everything here runs on a small **anonymized** slice of real FlyRank search data. No credentials,
no private client data, no setup headaches.

> **New here?** Two reads: **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)** (GitHub, Colab, and data access — ten
> minutes, with every silent pitfall flagged), then **[GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md)** (every file
> explained, what to edit vs. leave alone, and where your own work goes — five minutes).

## Your assignment notebooks — open, fill, save, done

Every assignment is one pre-named skeleton notebook in `work/notebooks/`. Click its badge,
fill the sections in order, then **File → Save a copy in GitHub → OK** — the dialog is
already pre-filled with your repo and the right path.

> **The badges know whose repo they're in.** About 30 seconds after you create your copy, an
> automatic commit ("Point Colab badges at this copy") rewires every badge in it to open
> **your** notebooks — with your saved work — instead of the shared read-only ones. Reading
> this on the shared starter page? The badges below open blank previews; make your copy
> first ([SETUP.md](SETUP.md), Moment 1).

Badges not opening *your* copy? Colab's built-in opener always works: **File → Open notebook
→ GitHub tab** → paste `github.com/you/your-repo` → pick the notebook.

### Prefer local?

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd flyrank-ml-internship-starter
pip install -r requirements.txt          # or: uv pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/run_all.py
```

That runs the whole pipeline on the bundled sample and writes results to `outputs/`.

---

## What you get

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `notebooks/` | Week 1–2 **first-win notebooks** (Colab-ready). Start here. |
| `scripts/01–05` + `run_all.py` | The runnable reference pipeline: prepare → baseline → train → evaluate → PDF. |
| `data/raw/content_refresh_anonymized.csv` | The anonymized starter dataset (~30k pages). |
| `outputs/` | Example outputs so you can see the **target shape** (`model_report.md`, `refresh_queue_sample.csv`, `charts/`). |
| `work/` | **Your space.** Lane experiments and your capstone live here — see `work/README.md`. |
| `docs/` | The core docs + the data dictionary (see below). |

### Read these (in `docs/`)

1. **`ml-core-foundation-framework.md`** — the first-principles map of ML as a whole system. The backbone of the live sessions.
2. **`ml-intern-dataset-and-lane-guide.md`** — how to use the data safely, the capstone workflow, and the analysis "lanes" you can pick from.
3. **`intern-free-tooling-guide.md`** — the zero-budget tool stack (Python, Colab, free AI assistants). You never need to pay for anything.
4. **`data-dictionary.md`** — all 44 columns: meaning, scale, and gotchas. Keep it open while you work.

---

## The pipeline (what `run_all.py` does)

```text
01_prepare_features.py   clean + build the feature vector, define the label
02_baseline_score.py     a transparent hand-rule "fix this first" score
03_train_model.py        logistic regression, decision tree, random forest (client-holdout split)
04_evaluate_and_export.py  ranked queue + charts + Markdown report
05_build_pdf_report.py   a shareable PDF summary
```

On the bundled sample, the learned model clearly beats the hand-written rule at picking the right
pages to review first (**Precision@50 ≈ 0.24 → 0.74**; the model number can land 0.68–0.74
depending on library versions — the ~3x lift is the point). The notebooks compute these numbers
live, so they always reflect the current data and environment.

**Teaching point:** the model is the capstone, but the *workflow* is the lesson —
`problem framing → data cleaning → baseline → first model → evaluation → explainable recommendation`.

## Data safety (read `DATA_USE.md`)

- Only the small **anonymized** CSV ships here — no client names, domains, URLs, titles, or keywords.
- **Never** add raw private client data to this repo or your fork. Need more data? Request an approved
  release from your mentor — never export it yourself.
- Don't paste client data into third-party AI tools.
- Frame every result as **observed / measured / directional / decision-support** — never
  "I predicted Google's algorithm."

The `.gitignore` blocks datasets by default, and CI fails any commit that includes a dataset.

---

## Assignments & schedule

Weekly assignments, live events, and the capstone live on **your portal board** (your
enrollment email has your access link). This repo is the shared technical foundation they all
build on — and the `skills/` folder here is the instruction library for your AI assistant
(start at [skills/README.md](skills/README.md)).

**First time with GitHub?** You need exactly four things (full walkthrough: [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)):
1. A free account at github.com.
2. Your own copy of this repo: **Use this template → Create a new repository** → public.
   (One click — brings the notebooks, `work/`, and the CI leak-guard with it.)
3. In Colab: *File → Save a copy in GitHub* — opened from your copy's badges, the dialog is
   already pre-filled with your repo and path, so it's just OK (Colab handles auth).
4. That's your submission repo — share its **github.com/you/your-repo** URL with Assignment 1
   (never a colab.research.google.com or drive.google.com link).
